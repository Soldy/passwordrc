# Outdated.
This password check is a rewrite of my old 2009 password strength checker. The code is cleaner and more S.O.L.I.D., but less precise and slower than his predecessor. Since no one uses it. (I am using the rust version) I am not willing to rewrite in Typescript, update, or implement a score-counting function.
Stay here as my archive. But that's all.

# passwordTest



```javascript

const passwordBase = new (require('passwordTest')).passwordBase();
passwordBase.check('password');

```
